# Required files (inputs):
* PDSA **xlsx** file - information about nodes (in this case, tables). The App presumes that file has at least two sheets:
  * One defining the tables (their names, id's, descriptions etc.)
  * One defining their columns (table name, dtype, null counts, descriptions etc.)
* Užklausa **xlsx** file - information about edges (relations between tables). Currently, app only requires to mark the columns that hold the names of source table and target table 

# Usage
### Before execution:
* Install required libraries
* Run `python app_tabs.py` in the terminal
* Open the link that appears in the terminal

### After execution :

The app is composed of two tabs: File upload and Dashboard (Grapher). Always start with the tab of File upload.
* File upload
  * After the link is open, upload the required files in the displayed fields.
  * Mark which sheets/columns hold the information
    * On the left (PDSA panel), choose which sheet holds information on tables and columns. Then, pick the columns that you want to see in the dashboard.  
    * On the right (Užklausa panel), choose which columns that hold the names of source table and target table.
  * **Always click** `Submit` - it summarizes the info that you filled in and passes it to the Grapher tab

* Visualization (Grapher)
  * In the grapher tab you'll find the panel to display the information that you submitted
  * Page layout:

    *   The left side displays network of your tables
    *   The right side displays filters that define what and how to display:
      * Set your layout - options for node arrangement in the graph
      * Select tables to graph, Add list of tables to graph (comma separated) - ways to declare tables to display. The selections are added up and send to the graph

* <del>Add dummy data</del>
* Option: display columns that join the tables
* Make a directed Graph - display relationships as arrows that show which node is source and which is arrow
* Add constraint on column choice in File upload tab - make columns "table" and "column" mandatory as they are necessary for filters and displays in the Grapher tab.  
* Deploy program to server so users with no programming knowledge could use it
